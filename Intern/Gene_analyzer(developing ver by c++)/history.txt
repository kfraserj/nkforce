1.  Implemented a new way to run tests: First read the sample file into a buffer and then iterate all test vectors,
    which gives a big speed boost -> now running all tests takes 2 seconds

(January 12, 2019)
1.  Now the program can run all the tests at once, which takes about 20 seconds(3 large tests & 7 small tests)

(January 11, 2019)
1.  Switch from debug mode to release mode. // CONFIG += release -> give a big speed boost
    Now each test takes about 1 seconds.
2.  Take off the multithreading method for now.
3.  Add new button: import samples
4.  Add new button: import tests
5.  Functionalize button: donwload a new test
6.  Functionalize button: export the results(.txt)
7.  Functionalize button: clear the results

1.  I am sick. Need to take a day off.

2.  Implemented multithreading. Each test takes about 4 sec.

(January 7, 2019)
1.  The program now can run single test. Each test takes about 30 sec.
